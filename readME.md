 This is a stactic website made usting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I made this to better understand HTML/CSS and how to integrate JavaScript. During this, I also learned how to use git version control, securing with SSL, as well as AWS hosting. The site was made to be mobile reponsive. Additionally I implemnted smooth scroll though JavaScript. Throughout this project, I was introduced to front-end web development and UI/UX elements. My favorite feature of this is in the about section, where there is a lookalike terminal.
